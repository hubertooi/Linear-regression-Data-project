# My first linear regression project

I follow the source code on kaggle created by Ariadne
url: https://www.kaggle.com/ariadne/simple-one-feature-linear-regression

Some of the code written by Ariadne is outdated.
I learn some codes are no longer working because updated libraries.

It consists of train.csv and test.csv randomly generated just for simple linear regression analysis.

This is my first project so it might have many errors or novice's method of doing.

# Comment and give me feedback to anyone who try out my code!!
